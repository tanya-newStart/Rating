## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

1. React Component Structure: I improved my understanding of organizing a React application into reusable components, for example separating the rating buttons into their own component.

2. State Management: I learned how to effectively manage and update state within React components, particularly for handling user interactions with the rating buttons.

3. Hover and Active States: I implemented interactive states for buttons, enhancing the user experience with visual feedback.

4. Conditional Rendering: I applied conditional rendering techniques to switch between the rating view and the thank you state.

5. Problem-Solving: I enhanced my ability to break down the design into manageable components and solve layout challenges, particularly in making the buttons responsive.
